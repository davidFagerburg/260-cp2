        <h2>What is D&D?</h2>
        <p>D&D, or Dungeons and Dragons, is a role-playing adventure game in which people come together to tell tales of adventure collaboratively. Each person brings their own insights and creativity to the table, where the Dungeon Master provides context and direction for the group's adventure. </p>
        <h2>But it seems nerdy?</h2>
        <p>There will always be people who think it's nerdy or even satanic <i>**cough cough <b>KAREN</b>**</i> but those people just don't understand the game. Is creativity, collaboration, and problem solving nerdy? It can be, if you make it. Satanic? I mean if you as a player or DM want to take it there, there isn't anything stopping you. But your adventures are your own. They can center around physical conflict and stats, or they can revolve around your own problem solving skills. It's up to you. D&D can be your creative canvas!</p>
        <h2>Where to begin?</h2>
        <p>The first thing you need is a character. This will determine a lot about how you play the game. This is the interface you will have with the imaginary world you're going to explore. Who will you be? The gigantic barbarian whose favorite solution to any problem is to hit it with a bigger stick? The old wizard whose power far outstrips her appearance? The Paladin, fighting for a god's cause, chaperoned by divine power?</p>
        <h2>There are many different aspects of a character, but here are the basics:</h2>
